            abstract = {In this paper, we consider the one-dimensional stochastic heat equation driven by a space–time white noise. In two different scenarios, (i) initial condition u0=1 and general nonlinear coefficient σ, (ii) initial condition u0=δ0 and σ(x)=x (Parabolic Anderson Model), we establish rates of convergence with respect to the uniform distance between the density of spatial averages of (renormalized) solution and the density of the standard normal distribution. These results are based on a combination of Stein’s method for normal approximations and Malliavin calculus techniques. A key ingredient in Case (i) is a new estimate on the Lp-norm of the second Malliavin derivative.}

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to establish the uniform convergence of the densities of a sequence of random variables, which are functionals of an underlying Gaussian process, to a normal density. Precise estimates for the uniform distance are derived by using the techniques of Malliavin calculus, combined with Steinʼs method for normal approximation. We need to assume some non-degeneracy conditions. First, the study is focused on random variables in a fixed Wiener chaos, and later, the results are extended to the uniform convergence of the derivatives of the densities and to the case of random vectors in some fixed chaos, which are uniformly non-degenerate in the sense of Malliavin calculus. Explicit upper bounds for the uniform norm are obtained for random variables in the second Wiener chaos, and an application to the convergence of densities of the least square estimator for the drift parameter in Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes is discussed.}

abstract={In this paper, we extend Walsh's stochastic integral with respect to a Gaussian noise, white in time and with some homogeneous spatial correlation, in order to be able to integrate some random measure-valued processes. This extension turns out to be equivalent to Dalang's one. Then we study existence and regularity of the density of the probability law for the real-valued mild solution to a general second order stochastic partial differential equation driven by such a noise. For this, we apply the techniques of the Malliavin calculus. Our results apply to the case of the stochastic heat equation in any space dimension and the stochastic wave equation in space dimension d=1,2,3. Moreover, for these particular examples, known results in the literature have been improved.},
